# GraphQl Refactor

## Description

This project is a factor of a project that was formerly using REST API. I refactored this project as a way to practice my skills using graphql. This was one of the hardest projects I have had to refactor. Because of the mix of REST and GraphQL, this project was more confusing, but I am confident in the results I have. I still prefer REST over GraphQl, but I believe this was a good exercise for me to practice my GraphQl skills.

## Installation

The following must be installed to run locally; graphQl, express, bcrypt, apollo-server-express, apollo-client, nodemon, jsonwebtoken, and mongoose.
